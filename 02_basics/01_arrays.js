//Arrays 
/*
>JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. (When those characteristics are undesirable,
 use typed arrays instead.)
>JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, 
 but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form) as indexes.
>JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on — and the
 last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1.
>JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects 
create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).

NOTE:A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references (point to the same underlying values) as 
those of the source object from which the copy was made. As a result, when you change either the source or the copy, you may 
also cause the other object to change too. That behavior contrasts with the behavior of a deep copy, in which the source and 
copy are completely independent.
